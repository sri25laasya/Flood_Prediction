d)Random Forest


a)Logistic Regression is a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict whether an input belongs to one of two possible classes.
The algorithm models the probability of the input belonging to one of the classes, based on the values of its input features. It uses a logistic function (also called sigmoid function) to transform the output of a linear equation into a probability score between 0 and 1.

b)Support Vector Machines: One of the advantages of SVM is its ability to handle high-dimensional datasets, as it can reduce the effect of the curse of dimensionality by maximizing the margin between the classes. It is also robust to overfitting, as it tries to find the hyperplane with the maximum margin, rather than fitting the data exactly.

c)KNN is a non-parametric algorithm, meaning that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. It is also easy to understand and implement, and can be used for both linear and non-linear problems.

d)In Random Forest, the algorithm builds an ensemble of decision trees by randomly selecting subsets of the input features and data samples. Each decision tree is trained on a different subset of the data and input features, and the final prediction is obtained by combining the predictions of all the trees. The goal of Random Forest is to reduce overfitting and increase the accuracy and generalization of the model.
